            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>  <img src="images/Wrap.jpg" id="wrap"><p></p>Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun 
                (born 16 July 1990), known professionally as Wizkid, is a Nigerian 
                singer and songwriter. <em>A prominent figure in the modern-day afrobeats </em> 
                music scene, Wizkid is regarded as one of the biggest 
                and most influential African artists of all time.
                He began recording music at the age of 11 and released a collaborative
                 album with the Glorious Five (5), <strong> a group he and a couple of his church friends formed.</strong>
                 In mid-2019, Wizkid was featured on Beyonc√©'s "Brown Skin Girl", taken from the critically acclaimed The Lion King:
                  The Gift soundtrack.[73] It was described
                  as one of his "shining" moments of 2019,[74] thanks to numerous nominations at major international awards, 
                  earning him two Soul Train Music Awards,
                  [75] a NAACP Image Award,[76] a BET Awards, and his first Grammy Award, for Best Music Video.[77]
                   Later that year, he also released the singles "Joro" and "Ghetto Love".[78]
                 On 6 December 2019, Wizkid's label Starboy Entertainment released the EP Soundman Vol. 1, centering mainly on Wizkid,
                  and containing features from Chronixx, and a variety of other artists. </p>

                  <blockquote>"Lagos style is fresh and different. Even with the tailors, they get very innovative with their stuff, with the cuts.
                     When my parents used to make the traditional wares, it was a little bit baggy. But now the tailors are able to infuse the 
                    European style, making it slim-fit. Lagos style is different, man. Innovative."</blockquote>
